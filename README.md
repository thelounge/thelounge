## Installation and usage

The Lounge requires latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS version or more recent.
[Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) is also recommended.  
If you want to install with npm, `--unsafe-perm` is required for a correct install.

When installed like this, `thelounge` executable is not created. Use `node index <command>` to run commands.
