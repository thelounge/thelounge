# TODO: Remove --exit once all event loop references are properly cleaned up
# Despite improvements to Socket.IO cleanup (disconnectSockets, signal handler removal,
# identd server closing), something still keeps the event loop alive after tests complete.
# Candidates: file watchers (fs.watch with persistent:false), pending timers, or
# Socket.IO internal state in v4.8.1. Further investigation needed.
